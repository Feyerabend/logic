## Early 1980's & personal experience

Some personal notes about the bump in AI in the early 1980's and my interest in these
events from a personal [VIEWPOINT](/VIEWPOINT.md) of the era.

Those reflections might also serve as the background to what was coming out of the
early years in e.g. the highly popular computer language of today: [ERLANG](ERLANG.md).
Actually Erlang was at first implemented in Prolog ...

## Prolog

Some simple implementation ...

## Lisp

Some simple implementation ...

A quick but nicely implemented Lisp as [minilisp](/minilisp) where the original can be found at [rui314](https://github.com/rui314), under [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain). Another implementation [tiny-lisp](/tinylisp) from [tiny-lisp by matp]https://github.com/matp/tiny-lisp) released under Unlicense.


## License

Every folder with code should be in the main self-contained, and few if any dependencies.
For each folder, if no other license has been explicitly added in that folder, the general
Unlicense apply. In other cases where a license has been added to the folder, or referenced
in other ways, the added or referenced license is applied and valid only in the case for the
content of that folder.

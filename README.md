## Early 1980's & personal experience

Some personal notes about the bump in AI in the early 1980's and my interest in these

early years in e.g. the highly popular computer language of today: [ERLANG](ERLANG.md).
Actually Erlang was at first implemented in Prolog ...

Some simple implementation ...

## Lisp

Some simple implementation ...

A quick but nicely implemented Lisp as [minilisp](/minilisp) where the original can be found at [rui314](https://github.com/rui314), under public domain.
